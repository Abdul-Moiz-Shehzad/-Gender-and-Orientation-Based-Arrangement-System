# -Gender-and-Orientation-Based-Arrangement-System
 This program arranges people in a matrix such that no two adjacent persons share the same gender or orientation. Using backtracking, stacks, and queues, the program reads data from a file and attempts all possible combinations to achieve the desired arrangement. The final matrix displays each person's gender and facing position.
